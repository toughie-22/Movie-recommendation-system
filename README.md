🎬 Movie Recommendation System

This project is a Movie Recommendation System built using Python and data science techniques. The goal is to suggest movies that users are likely to enjoy, based on similarity in content and user preferences.

Instead of just picking random recommendations, the system analyzes features such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew to build connections between movies. It then ranks and recommends films that share the most in common.

🚀 Features

i.Recommends movies based on content similarity.

ii.Uses vectorization and cosine similarity for finding relationships.

iii.Clean and simple Jupyter Notebook workflow for experimentation.

iv.Can be extended into a web app (e.g., using Flask/Streamlit).

🛠️ Tech Stack

i.Python (core language)

ii.Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)

iii.Scikit-learn (vectorization & similarity computation)

ivNLTK / text preprocessing tools (for cleaning movie metadata)

⚡ How It Works

i.Load the dataset (movie metadata).

ii.Preprocess text (genres, keywords, cast, crew).

iii.Convert the cleaned text into vectors using CountVectorizer or TF-IDF.

iv.Calculate cosine similarity between movies.

v.Recommend the top-N most similar movies for a given title.

▶️ Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system

2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the notebook

Open Jupyter Notebook and run:

jupyter notebook "Movie recommendation system.ipynb"

📊 Example Output

If you input:

recommend("Avatar")


You might get recommendations like:

i.Guardians of the Galaxy

ii.Star Trek

iii.The Fifth Element

iv.John Carter

v.Interstellar

🎯 Future Improvements

i.Add a collaborative filtering approach.

ii.Deploy as a Streamlit web app for easier interaction.

iii.Enhance text preprocessing with more NLP techniques.
